# Azure Databricks to Purview Lineage Connector

This solution accelerator, together with the [OpenLineage](http://openlineage.io) project, provides a connector that will transfer lineage metadata from Spark operations in Azure Databricks to Microsoft Purview, allowing you to see a table-level lineage graph as demonstrated above.

> **Note**
> In addition to this solution accelerator, Microsoft Purview is creating native models for Azure Databricks (e.g.: Notebooks, jobs, job tasks...) to integrate with Catalog experiences. With native models in Microsoft Purview for Azure Databricks, customers will get enriched experiences in lineage such as detailed transformations.
> If you choose to use this solution accelerator in a Microsoft Purview account before the native models are released, these enriched experiences are not backward compatible.
> Please reach out to your Microsoft account representative for timeline related questions on the upcoming model enrichment for Azure Databricks in Microsoft Purview.**

## Overview

Gathering lineage data is performed in the following steps:

![high-level-architecture.png](./assets/img/readme/high-level-architecture.svg)

1. Azure Databricks clusters are configured to initialize the OpenLineage Spark Listener with an endpoint to receive data.
1. Spark operations will output data in a standard OpenLineage format to the endpoint configured in the cluster.
1. Endpoint provided by an Azure Function app that will filter incoming data and pass it to an Azure EventHub.
1. Events are captured by a second Function app to transform the data into a format compatible with Atlas and Purview.
1. Lineage data is synchronized with existing Purview metadata and uploaded to Purview using standard Apache Atlas APIs.

## Features

* Supports table level lineage from Spark Notebooks and jobs for the following data sources:
  * Azure SQL
  * Azure Synapse Analytics
  * Azure Data Lake Gen 2
  * Azure Blob Storage
  * Delta Lake
* Supports Spark 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 (Interactive and Job clusters) / Spark 2.x (Job clusters)
  * Databricks Runtimes between 6.4 and 10.4 are currently supported
* Can be configured per cluster or for all clusters as a global configuration  
* Once configured, <span style="color: red;">**does not require any code changes to notebooks or jobs**</span>
* Can [add new source support through configuration](./extending-source-support.md)

## Prerequisites

Installing this connector requires the following:

1. Azure subscription-level role assignments for both `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator`.
1. Azure Service Principal with client ID and secret - [How to create Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

## Getting Started

There are two deployment options for this solution accelerator:

* ### [Demo Deployment](./deploy-demo.md)

    No additional prerequisites are necessary as the demo environment will be setup for you, including Azure Databricks, Purview, ADLS, and example data sources and notebooks.

* ### [Connector Only Deployment](./deploy-base.md)

    If installed as a working connector, Azure Databricks, data sources, and Microsoft Purview are assumed to be setup and running.

## Using the Connector

*Ensure both the Azure Function app and Azure Databricks cluster are running.*

1. Open your Databricks workspace to run a Spark job or notebook which results in data being transferred from one location to another. For the demo deployment, browse to the Workspace > Shared > abfss-in-abfss-out-olsample notebook, and click "Run all".

1. Once complete, open your Purview workspace and click the "Browse assets" button near the center of the page

1. Click on the "By source type" tab  
You should see several items listed under the heading of "Custom source types".  There will be a Databricks section and possibly a Purview Custom Connector section under this heading

    ![browse_assets.png](./assets/img/readme/browse_assets.png)

1. Click on the "Databricks" section, then click on the "Databricks Notebook" tile which corresponds to the notebook you ran. In the Properties or Related tabs select one of the "Notebook Tasks" which represent a task in a Databricks job. From the "Databricks Notebook Task", you may see the lineage of one or many of the different spark actions in the notebook.  This application may have a number of "Databricks Processes" linked under it which represent the data lineage.  To see these, see the Properties or  Related tabs

    ![databricks_task_related.png](./assets/img/readme/databricks_task_related.png)

1. From the Related view, click on the processes icon, then click on one of the links representing the associated process objects

1. Click on the properties tab to view the properties associated with the process.  Note that the full Spark Plan is included

    ![spark_plan.png](./assets/img/readme/spark_plan.png)

1. Click to the lineage view to see the lineage graph

    ![lineage_view.png](./assets/img/readme/lineage_view.png)

    **Note**: If you are viewing the Databricks Process shortly after it was created, sometimes the lineage tab takes some time to display. If you do not see the lineage tab, wait a few minutes and then refresh the browser.

## Troubleshooting

**When filing a new issue, [please include associated log message(s) from Azure Functions](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md#debug-logs).** This will allow the core team to debug within our test environment to validate the issue and develop a solution.

If you have any issues, please start with the [Troubleshooting Doc](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and note the [limitations](./LIMITATIONS.md) which affect what sort of lineage can be collected. If the problem persists, please raise an [Issue on Github](https://github.com/microsoft/Purview-ADB-Lineage-Solution-Accelerator/issues).

## Limitations

The solution accelerator has some [limitations which affect what sort of lineage can be collected](./LIMITATIONS.md).
